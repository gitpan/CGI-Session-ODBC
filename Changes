Revision history for CGI::Session::ODBC:

0.50 Tues Oct 26 2004
    - Changed queries to parametrized versions (Rhesa Rozendaal).  Session
      creation becomes slightly slower, but other session operations are
      about 50% faster.
    - Fixed bug where changes to session table name were being ignored
      (rt.cpan.org bug #5318).
    - Beefed up test suite.
