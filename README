CGI::Session::ODBC version 0.01
===============================

CGI::Session::ODBC provides an ODBC database driver for use with 
CGI::Session.  In theory, it should work with any ODBC-accessible
database product, but the author provides no guarantees.

This module has been tested under Windows XP Professional, Apache 2.0.46,
and ActiveState Perl 5.8.0 Build 806.  It has been used to store and
access session data in Microsoft Access XP, Microsoft SQL Server 2000,
and MySQL 4.0.13.

There are no special provisions made for row-level locking.  ODBC is intended
to be platform independent, and to the best of the author's knowledge at the
time of this writing, there is no platform independent manner of implementing
row locking.  Please contact the author with your experiences with this module
in that regard.

The test suite leaves something to be desired.  See the comments in t/1.t to
see what I am talking about.  The default test suite checks the existence of
CGI::Session::ODBC and exists.  If you would like to perform more in-depth
tests, perform the following steps:

1) Create the following table in your ODBC-compliant database:

   CREATE TABLE sessions (
       id CHAR(32) NOT NULL,
       a_session TEXT NOT NULL
   );

2) Change %options in t/1.t to something suitable for your database
   installation.
   
3) Comment out these three lines in t/1.t:

   use Test::More tests => 1;
   use_ok('CGI::Session::ODBC');
   exit();

CGI::Session, DBI, and DBD::ODBC must be installed in order to use this
module.

This is the initial release of this module.  Should you encounter any issues
in its use, please contact the author, Jason A. Crome <cromedome@cpan.org>.
