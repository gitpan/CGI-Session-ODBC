NAME
    CGI::Session::ODBC - ODBC driver for CGI::Session

VERSION
        Version 0.50

SYNOPSIS
        use CGI::Session;
        $session = new CGI::Session("driver:ODBC", undef, { Handle => $dbh });

    For more examples, consult the CGI::Session manual.

DESCRIPTION
    CGI::Session::ODBC is a CGI::Session driver to store session data in any
    ODBC-capable database. To write your own drivers for "CGI::Session",
    please refer to the CGI::Session manual.

USAGE
    To store session data in the ODBC-compliant database, you must first
    create a suitable table for your session data to live. In many
    instances, the following SQL will accomplish this:

        CREATE TABLE sessions (
            id CHAR(32) NOT NULL,
            a_session TEXT NOT NULL
        );

    You can add any number of additional columns to the table, but the
    columns "id" and "a_session" are required as defined above. If you want
    to store the session data in a table other than "sessions", you will
    also need to specify the TableName attribute as an argument:

        use CGI::Session;

        $session = new CGI::Session("driver:ODBC", undef,
            { Handle => $dbh, TableName => 'my_sessions' });

    There are no special provisions made for row-level locking. ODBC is
    intended to be platform independent, and to the best of the author's
    knowledge at the time of this writing, there is no platform independent
    manner of implementing row locking. Please contact the author with your
    experiences with this module in that regard.
